Identifying Shopping Trends Using Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze shopping behavior and identify emerging trends using data analysis techniques. By examining sales data, customer demographics, and market trends, we can provide insights into consumer preferences, seasonal trends, and factors influencing purchasing decisions.

Objectives

Identify popular products and categories.

Analyze seasonal or periodic shopping trends.

Understand customer demographics and preferences.

Predict future shopping trends using machine learning models.

Provide actionable insights for businesses to optimize marketing and inventory strategies.

Data Collection & Sources

1. Sales Data – Transactional data from online or offline stores.


2. Customer Demographics – Age, gender, location, purchasing behavior.


3. Website Analytics – Click-through rates, time spent on pages, abandoned carts.


4. Social Media Trends – Customer reviews, hashtags, sentiment analysis.


5. Economic Indicators – Inflation rates, employment rates, etc.

Data Processing & Analysis

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handle missing values and duplicates.

Normalize data (e.g., standardize prices, categories).



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify trends using histograms, scatter plots, and time-series graphs.

Use clustering (e.g., k-means) to segment customers based on behavior.



3. Trend Identification

Use moving averages to detect seasonal patterns.

Sentiment analysis on product reviews and social media discussions.



4. Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning

Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) for predicting future sales.

Classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for customer segmentation.

Market basket analysis (Apriori algorithm) for identifying frequently bought items together.
